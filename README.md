# SmartPrintScreen for Android
The Android version of my program SmartPrintScreen that was originally made for Windows: https://github.com/entdark/SmartPrintScreen

# Features
Each time you take a screenshot it gets uploaded on imgur.com anonymously and copies the uploaded image URL to the clipboard.  
Then you can just paste the URL in any IM service to share with your friends.  
Screenshot URLs are listed in the application and you are able to remove them if necessary.

The latest release could be found in "releases" tab.
